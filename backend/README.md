# Thought process for the backend creation

- the weather app doesn't need auth, doesn't require users since the scoper is so limited
    - which is why i can remove the need for db's for now
- I will probably try to implement it further down since that removal of steps hinders my knowledge

- Only things required as of now:
    - A get request, prolly could rate limit but I won't keep the site up for long so nah
